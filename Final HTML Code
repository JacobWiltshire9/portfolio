            <img src="darkmatter.png" alt = "Dark Matter photo" height = "300" width = "400">
            <p>- This is going to give some tips on how to get Dark Matter in Multiplayer</p>
            <p>- When you're grinding for Dark Matter one of the easiest ways to get your 100 headshots is to take advantage of Hardcore Nuketown 24/7 and Core or Hardcore Stakeout 24/7 when these maps are available.</p>
            <p>- Hardcore is good for getting headshots because most guns are 1 shot to the head in order to get a kill and others will be 2 shots to the head.</p>
            <p>- Stakeout is good for getting headshots but also easy to get double kills, triple kills, 3 kills without dying, and bloodthirsty's since the map is so close quarted and small it helps getting gun fights easier.</p>
            <img src="nebula.png" alt = "Nebula photo" height = "300" width = "400">
            <p>- Down here I'll give some tips on how to get Nebula in Zombies.</p>
            <p>- Getting 2000 critical kills with each gun is very time consuming and will be a grind for sure but there is one method I found to make things a little easier.</p>
            <p>- Load into Liberty Falls in Directed Mode with the gun you want to work on for that game, Go through the map following the icons telling you which doors to open.</p>
            <p>- Once you open up pack-a-punch an icon will pop up in pack-a-punch room. DO NOT INTERACT with the machine because it will start the easter egg. If you don't interact with the machine the round cap will be at round 11.</p>
            <p>- With the round cap being at 11 you will be able to still upgrade your gun to pack-a-punch III and get your perks but the round will not progress past round 11 and zombies will keep spawning meaning your gun will be very strong for round 11 zombies.</p>
